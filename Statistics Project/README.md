The purpose of this project was to utilize principal component analysis (PCA) and structural equation modelling (SEM) to find out what factors contribute to poor mental and physical health in Americans. We used data from the General Social Survey (GSS) which is a survey conducted every 2 years by the National Opinion Research Center (NORC). It is an extremely broad survey which asks participants about a wide range of topics such as life satisfaction, general health, and salary among many others. Consequently, there are many directions we could have gone with our project, but ultimately, we decided to focus on two metrics, those being the number of poor physical health days, and the number of poor mental health days experienced in the last month.

We decided to look at these metrics as improving mental and physical health in America is probably a good thing for society overall. We knew that mental and physical health likely have a huge number of contributing factors, but pinpointing a few might actually be helpful for some people. This also tied in quite nicely with the “Common Good” theme that is featured so prominently at St. Thomas.

Our results were a bit of a mixed bag. On one hand, we found many factors that seemed to be statistically significant predictors of mental/physical health. If you look at our SEM output you will see that 8 of our SEM inputs had p-values <0.01. We saw that things like marital happiness, life satisfaction, and job satisfaction all had a huge effect on mental/physical health. Even political views had a statistically significant effect (being politically conservative tends to mean you have more poor mental and physical health days, though the effect magnitude wasn’t very high compared to other factors). However, when looking at the fit indices of our model, we were close to but not adequately similar to the original covariance structure of the data. This means that our conclusions may not actually be valid, though it is likely that the trends we noticed do exist in some capacity.
