Senior Portfolio

Sam Largaespada

I chose these projects for my portfolio as I felt like they highlight some of the unique skills and insights I’ve gained over the last 2 years at St. Thomas. These projects include a simulation of the buddy memory allocation system, a database and graphical user interface (GUI) for tracking friends and their gaming activity, and a data analysis project which used Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to predict mental and physical health based on various factors.


**Project 1: Buddy Buffer Manager**

The buddy memory allocation system is an algorithm that operating systems, most notably Linux, use to manage blocks of memory in an efficient way. For this project I had to essentially simulate this process with a large variety of test cases. From a technical perspective this project allowed me to work with and explore several computer science concepts such as memory management, binary trees, and even a little bit of time complexity (though that was not part of the assignment).

Other than the technical implementation, I thought that this project connected to real-world problems like resource allocation. This topic can be extrapolated to many different fields like healthcare or energy grids. I doubt that my specific algorithms can be used there, but I do think I’m better equipped to solve those sorts of problems because of it. Ultimately, I think optimizing resource use is a valuable thing to strive for in our society, which in the end helps to improve the “Common Good”.


**Project 2: Videogame Database and GUI**

This project involved designing and implementing a database and GUI that allows users to manage a library of games and friends list, as well as several other features. The database was structured with SQL and SQLAlchemy, and the GUI was built with the Tkinter library. Overall, this project utilized skills in database creation and management, user experience design, and teamwork in general.

From a broad perspective, this project touched on the importance of social connection and sharing. Video games are a big industry today, and I can honestly say I have connected with my peers through videogames many times. Social isolation is becoming a bigger and bigger issue in the internet age but socializing through gaming seems like it could counteract that problem, at least in a small way.


**Project 3: Predicting Mental and Physical Health Outcomes with SEM and PCA**

For this project we analyzed a dataset to predict mental and physical health problems using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The dataset included variables such as income, physical characteristics, and life satisfaction. By applying these statistical techniques, we were able to find some patterns/relationships that contribute to poor health outcomes.

Honestly this is probably the project that most directly dealt with the topic of the “Common Good”. It really showed me how statistics and computer science can be used to address societal issues. Mental and physical health are major global issues right now, and using data-driven approaches to me seems like the absolute best way to deal with them. Similar projects could be used to enact actual policy decisions or inform the creation of new programs or even laws.


**Conclusion**

Each of these projects reflects some core aspects of St. Thomas’s mission and values, especially when it comes to the “Common Good”. The buddy buffer project highlights efficient allocation of resources, the gaming database highlights social connection, and the SEM project highlights health disparity and the factors that cause it. I think that computer science and statistics are great ways to try to address these issues in the modern world. Overall, my degree has vastly improved my technical skills, while simultaneously growing my understanding of how I can improve the common good wherever I end up.
